# c_playground
My personal sandbox for all C work

This is mostly just to keep track of the work I do. None of these are production ready obviously - just the crazed meanderings of a sub-par coder exploring C. 

If you do want to run these (Linux only) - use the following gcc command: 

`gcc main.c -Wall -Wextra -std=c2x --pedantic && ./a.out`
